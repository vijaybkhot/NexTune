## Live Demo
Check out the live application here: [NexTune Live](https://nex-tune.vercel.app/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: On the free tier, Render may take up to ~50 seconds for the initial load as the app spins up. Subsequent requests are much faster.

## About This Project

NexTune is designed as a scalable, developer-friendly platform demonstrating my expertise in modern web development technologies and best practices. It showcases:

- Building robust full-stack applications using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **GraphQL**
- Integrating databases (**MongoDB**, **Redis**) for efficient data storage and caching
- Implementing clean architecture with separation of concerns and reusable components
- Managing complex data relationships in a music catalog domain
- Writing production-ready code with deployment pipelines (Vercel & Render)

## Why This Project Matters

- Showcases proficiency in modern JavaScript and TypeScript frameworks such as React, Next.js, and Apollo Client  
- Demonstrates backend development skills including API design with GraphQL and database management using MongoDB and Redis  
- Highlights the ability to build scalable, maintainable, and production-ready full-stack applications  
- Includes real-world features like CRUD operations, dynamic UI components, and efficient data caching  
- Reflects experience with deployment workflows on cloud platforms like Vercel and Render  
- Illustrates strong problem-solving abilities through handling complex data relationships and input validation

‚∏ª

#### 2. Set Environment Variables

üîß Server (/server/.env)

Create a .env file inside the server directory with the following fields:

NODE_ENV=
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=
PORT=
CLIENT_ORIGIN=
MONGO_URI=
REDIS_HOST=
REDIS_PORT=
REDIS_USER=
REDIS_PASSWORD=

üåê Client (/client/.env.local)

Create a .env.local file inside the client directory with:

NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=


‚∏ª

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Server

cd server
npm install

Client

cd ../client
npm install


‚∏ª

#### 4. Seed the Database

To drop and reseed the database with initial data (artists, albums, songs, record companies):

cd server
npm run seed


‚∏ª

#### 5. Start the Development Servers

Start the GraphQL Server

cd server
nodemon server.js
